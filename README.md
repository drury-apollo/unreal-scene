## current notes
Currently, we really just have some camera rigs set up and not much else. While there's nothing to take a screenshot automatically right now, you can take a screenshot from the perspective of the camera after starting the game with tilde "~" which will allow you to run the command HighResShot 1920x1080 (for testing purposes)
